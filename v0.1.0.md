## Tarot Solver v0.1.0

### Overview

Tarot Solver v0.1.0 is the **first public preview** of the project: a French Tarot game engine with reinforcement learning tooling and early league orchestration, plus a **work‑in‑progress GUI shell**.

This release focuses on getting a **solid, well‑tested backend** in place for 3, 4 and 5 players, along with a command‑line interface and Python APIs suitable for experiments, training and tournaments.

### Highlights

- **Full Tarot engine (3/4/5 players)**
  - Implements the official FFT rules: dealing, bidding (Prise, Garde, Garde sans, Garde contre), chien/écart, trick play and scoring.
  - Correct handling of special rules: Excuse, Petit au Bout, Poignées and Chelem.
  - Match play for N deals with rotating dealer and official-style scoring.

- **RL‑ready environments**
  - Gym‑like `TarotEnv3P/4P/5P` environments with flat observations and masked discrete action space.
  - Support for single learning seat with configurable opponents.

- **Training and league tooling**
  - Custom PyTorch PPO trainer for 4‑player matches.
  - Tournament and league orchestration with ELO ratings and simple genetic algorithm helpers.
  - `tarot` CLI with commands for training, evaluation and league runs.

- **GUI (under construction)**
  - PySide6 desktop shell with placeholder tabs for Dashboard, League, Agents, Play and Settings.
  - Currently non‑functional and intended only as a preview of the future UI.

### Notes

- The recommended way to work with this release is via the **Python API and CLI**, not the GUI.
- The code and interfaces are still subject to change as the project evolves toward a more user‑friendly v0.2.x+.
